# HTML & CSS Course Assignment

## Goal

To put into practice everything you've learned about HTML and CSS over this course by bringing your design alive. You will be creating a simple multipage web application using the design from your previous CA.

## Brief

- You must deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief you chose in Design 1.
- The site needs to have every page listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief. Certain functionality requiring JavaScript can be mimicked; for example, a login page could link across from the 'Sign in' button.
- The HTML should be semantic, neatly formatted and valid.
- The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
- The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap; we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
- The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
- Each page should have a unique &lt;meta name="description"&gt; , &lt;title&gt;, and &lt;h1&gt;.
- You should not use copied code in your submission. All code submitted must be written by yourself. You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific effects, which should be included in your report.

## Process

- Visit the <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/mWRfivZL" target="_blank"><strong>link</strong></a> in the assignment in Teams to accept the assignment in GitHub Classroom. If this is an issue, please create your own repository in your Github account (create one if you don't have one yet), and copy the contents of the extracted zip folder to your repository.
- Clone the repository to your computer using GitHub Desktop.
- Spend some time going through your design files and thinking about which tags and approaches you will need.
- Write a basic plan for how to approach this, what will you do first? What will you do last?
- Work through your plan to create HTML files for each page.
- Work through the design to create a CSS stylesheet with your theme.
- Test your website using your developer tools and also test on major browsers and various devices.
- Validate your code using the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Markup Validation Service</strong></a>
- Use the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank"><strong>WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools</strong></a> to test that your site matches best practices for accessibility
- When your site is ready, post it for Peer Review on Teams asking for other students to provide feedback.
- Look at the work of your peers and review 2 other projects.
- Make adjustments based on the feedback you gather.
- Delivery in Teams. If you are unsure of how to do this, ask your teacher.
